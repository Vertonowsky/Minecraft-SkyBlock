# Minecraft-SkyBlock

Have you ever wanted to play on the most unique Minecraft SkyBlock server? Did it require building your own plugins? Probably not, but what if you actually tried your skills and made everything by yourself how you always imagined the best SkyBlock would look like? Age basically doesn't matter. Do your best and keep going forward! Application finished at age of 18.


Looking back on this project now, I would have written many things differently. 
However first project is only one and every project can be the last.
